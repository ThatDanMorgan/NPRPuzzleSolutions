This week's puzzle:
Name a well known movie of the past two words 7 letters in total, these 7 letters can be rearranged spell the name of an animal and the sound it makes.

What we know:
- The movie title has a space in it.  That's going to eliminate a good number of movies.
- The movie title is 7 letters long.  So 8 characters long.
- The answer includes an animal name.  Given 7 letters we can eliminate all animals greater than 7 letters and most likely any animal that is 5 letters long as most sounds require at least two words.
- The same answer is true of the sound.  It has to be at least 5 letters long.

Some other stray thoughts:
Three letter animals often have 4 letter sounds:  "dog bark" and "cat meow".  Seems too obvious but we might as well take a stab on paper.

cat meow -> meat cow -> team cow -> cow mate -> wet coma

dog bark -> dark bog -> bag dork 

(Probably not those!)
Also:
However, animals make multiple sounds like dog's go "bark" and "ruff".

Let's start with the data first and work from there.  If we had a list of animals and their associated sounds, we could buld a very nice map, keyed on the two words mashed together with the object being saved at each key being animal and sound.  With movies, we simply can key it out the same way and check for a match.

Which do we start with?  Time to start googling for easy pages to scrape data from!

A great start already: http://www.hometheaterinfo.com/dvdlist.htm

A quick conversation with my wife and...

We came up with the answer:  "La Bamba" -> "Lamb Baa"
